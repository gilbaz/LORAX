~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*An RSCS implementation is included.
In addition a fixed-RSCS algorithm is also implemented. 
It is an augmentation of the original algorithm that allows for better parametric control. 
Using this you can define exactly how many Super-points should be created, how many points in each Super-point.

*The basis code for the Super-point Auto-encoder Feature generator will be included.
